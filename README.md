This crate implements an AA Tree in Rust. An AA Tree is basically a Red-Black Tree that disallows right children to be red. This results for less complexity in the implementation. For further details on the data structure, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree for more information on the data structure.

The standard library comes with a good set of data structures. See [`std::collections`] for a list of data structures and their (dis)advantages, however, not all advertised functionality of `BTreeMap` is actually implemented (at the time of writing). On average, this AA Tree implementation is about half as fast as the standard libraries `BTree` data structures.

## When to use `AATree` over `std::collections::BTree`

- Your application doesn't benefit from CPU caching but does from simpler implementations
- You want to find the largest or smallest key that is smaller or larger than something
- You need a BST that you can freely search with your own routine

## When to use `AATree` over `std::vec::Vec`

- You need a sorted data structure
- You need to efficiently check whether a key is contained or not
- You need a BST that you can freely search with your own routine

## Versioning

As all rust crates, this crate will follow semantic versioning guidelines. However, increasing the MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is not considered a breaking change.
